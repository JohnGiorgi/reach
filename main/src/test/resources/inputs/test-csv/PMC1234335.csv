Six SRC-3 phosphorylation sites have been identified, and these can be induced by steroids, cytokines, and growth factors, involving multiple kinase signaling pathways. Using phosphospecific antibodies for six phosphorylation sites, we investigated the mechanisms involved in estradiol (E2)-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation and found that this occurs only when either activated estrogen receptor  (ER) or activated ER is present. Both the activation function 1 and the ligand binding domains of ER are required for maximal induction. Mutations in the coactivator binding groove of the ER ligand binding domain inhibit E2-stimulated SRC-3 phosphorylation, as do mutations in the nuclear receptor-interacting domain of SRC-3, suggesting that ER must directly contact SRC-3 for this posttranslational modification to take place. A transcriptionally inactive ER mutant which localizes to the cytoplasm supports E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation. Mutations of the ER DNA binding domain did not block this rapid E2-dependent SRC-3 phosphorylation. Together these data demonstrate that E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation is dependent on a direct interaction between SRC-3 and ER and can occur outside of the nucleus. Our results provide evidence for an early nongenomic action of ER on SRC-3 that supports the well-established downstream genomic roles of estrogen and coactivators."PMC1234335,3,"Steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3, also known as AIB1/ACTR/RAC3/pCIP/TRAM-1) is a member of the SRC/p160 family of transcription coactivators for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors . Loss of SRC-3 expression in cells severely impairs the transcriptional output from nuclear receptors. SRC-3 is overexpressed in a significant percentage of breast cancers, and in its role as an oncogene, it is involved in the development and maintenance of breast and prostate cancers . The activities of the SRC coactivators are affected by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination . We and others have shown that SRC-3 activity is regulated by phosphorylation, which dramatically affects its association with nuclear receptors and other coregulators and transcription factors and its coactivator functions, subcellular localization, and oncogenic activities . This phosphorylation can be induced by different stimuli including steroid hormones, growth factors, and cytokines and involves a wide range of kinases including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 MAPK, and IB kinases (IKKs) . Six in vivo SRC-3 phosphorylation sites have been identified (Fig. 1A), and phosphorylation statespecific antibodies against each site have been generated and validated . Different stimuli induce distinct patterns of SRC-3 phosphorylation, and mutations at different phosphorylation sites have different downstream effects. For example, 17-estradiol (E2) induces SRC-3 phosphorylation at all six sites, while tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induces phosphorylation of all but the serine-860 (S860) site . Consistent with these data, mutation of any of the six phosphorylation sites to an alanine residue impairs the ability of the mutant SRC-3 to coactivate E2-induced estrogen receptor  (ER) target gene expression in reporter assays, while all but S860 mutations affect TNF-alpha-induced NF-B target gene activation. Likewise, mutation of the threonine-24 (T24), S543, S857, and S867 sites, but not the S505 and S860 sites, negatively influences the expression of the SRC-3 target gene interleukin-6, while the tumorigenic activity of SRC-3, demonstrated via its ability to potentiate cellular transformation by RasV12, is affected by mutation of all the phosphorylation sites except S505 . These observations likely result from the different affinities of various SRC-3 phosphorylation site mutants for other coregulators and transcription factors such as CBP, CARM1, ER, and NF-B . How E2 induces phosphorylation of SRC-3 is poorly understood. The major biological functions of E2 are mediated through ER and ER, which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. Estradiol can induce cellular responses through direct ""genomic"" ER-dependent activation of gene transcription at target promoters as well as by ""nongenomic"" actions, the latter including rapid activation of various protein kinase cascades independent of prior gene transcription . Nongenomic E2-activated pathways may be ER dependent. For example, E2 can induce a rapid and transient activation of the Src/Erk phosphorylation cascade through the association between cytoplasm-localized ER and MNAR (modulator of nongenomic activity of ER) . Alternatively, in an ER-independent fashion, E2 has been shown to activate the MAPK pathway through the membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptor GPR30 . Whether E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation is mediated through a ""genomic"" or ""nongenomic"" activity of E2 and its dependence on ER is unclear at present."PMC1234335,4,"Estradiol induction of SRC-3 phosphorylation. (A) Schematic diagram of SRC-3. The known functional domains of SRC-3 are shown on top: bHLH/PAS, basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim domain; RID, receptor-interacting domain; CID, CBP/p300-interacting domain; HAT, histone acetyltransferase domain. The identity and position of the six identified phosphorylated amino acids of SRC-3 are shown below. (B) Estradiol induced an ER-dependent change in electrophoretic mobility of SRC-3. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids for either Flag-tagged wild-type SRC-3 (SRC-3) or a FlagSRC-3 mutant (A6) in which alanines were substituted for all six phosphorylation sites (S/T to A), and either ER or ER, or empty vectors (V). Forty-eight hours posttransfection, 0.01% ethanol () or 10 nM estradiol (E2; ) was added for 1 h. Cells were then lysed and analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-SRC-3 antibody."PMC1234335,5,"Estrogen receptors regulate the differentiation and maintenance of many tissues including reproductive, neural, skeletal, and cardiovascular tissues  and possess several domains essential for their functions . The transcriptional activity of ER is dependent on two activation function (AF) domains, AF-1 at the N terminus and AF-2 in the C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD). The AF-1 domain can exert its activity in a ligand-independent manner , while AF-2 activity is dependent on agonist binding to the LBD . Both AF-1 and AF-2 activities are associated with their abilities to bind to coregulators. The DNA binding domain (DBD) contains two zinc finger motifs, which bind to specific estrogen response elements (EREs) within the promoters of ER target genes (25). The first zinc finger contains a P box directly contacting DNA, and the latter contains a D box responsible for ER dimerization . The hinge region which is located between DBD and LBD contains most of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) . Estrogen receptor shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm, although under steady-state conditions it is mainly detected in the nucleus . In the absence of ligand, 5 to 10% of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ER is localized in the cytoplasm . Estradiol increases ER nuclear localization. It also has been shown that E2 induces a translocalization of SRC-3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus . Up to now, the ""classical"" mode of activation of coactivators and their interaction with transcription factors were believed to occur on nuclear promoters in response to different stimuli . The ligand-dependent interaction between nuclear receptors and SRC-3 is direct and is mediated through the LBD domains and the LXXLL motifs, respectively . Upon binding to an agonist, ER undergoes a conformational change and presents a coactivator-binding groove on the surface of its LBD capable of binding to the LXXLL motifs . This coactivator-binding groove involves residues (e.g., K362, V376, and L539) from several helices, H3 to H5 and H12 . After coactivator binding, ER LBD undergoes a further conformational change, resulting in a more stable receptor . There are three LXXLL motifs located in the receptorinteracting domain of SRC-3 . Mutations that disrupt the formation of the coactivator-binding groove of ER or mutations in the LXXLL motifs of SRC-3 abolish interaction between SRC-3 and ER and thus coactivation of ER . Here we show that E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation requires a direct interaction between SRC-3 and ER but does not require DNA binding and nuclear localization of ER, indicating a ""nongenomic"" action of this receptor. Both ER AF-1 and AF-2 domains are required for a maximal induction of coactivator phosphorylation. These results indicate that, in addition to ""genomic"" and transcription-dependent activities of ER, ""nongenomic"" activities of ER can significantly influence SRC-3 functions, suggesting a multilevel functional cooperation between coactivators and nuclear receptors on and off their target genes."PMC1234335,6,"The phosphorylation status of SRC family members has been shown to be important for their biological functions including their coactivator activities and tumorigenic potentials . Hormones and growth factors induce SRC phosphorylation, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. Estrogen can induce posttranslational modifications through either ""genomic"" or ""nongenomic"" pathways . The ""genomic"" effects of estradiol are mainly mediated by ERs over the time course of hours to days and relate to an activated receptor's ability to bind to promoters of estrogen-responsive target genes involved in cellular signaling . The ""nongenomic"" effects of estrogen are mediated through activation of cellular signaling pathways independent of transcription and can be either ER dependent or independent, occurring over a time course of seconds to minutes . Here we report that E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation occurs within minutes and requires a direct interaction between SRC-3 and ER but does not require nuclear localization or the DNA binding activity of ER. However, both the AF-1 and LBD/AF-2 domains of ER are essential for maximal E2 induction of SRC-3 phosphorylation. These results lead to a model in which the posttranslational modification of SRC-3 is the result of a transcription-independent and ""nongenomic"" action of ER that occurs in an extranuclear complex containing SRC-3 and ER. We found that both the ER AF-1 and AF-2 domains are necessary for robust induction of SRC-3 phosphorylation by E2 and that a direct interaction between the ER LBD and coactivator is required. The inability of the SERMs, 4HT and raloxifene, to induce SRC-3 phosphorylation is consistent with both of these points. Even though SERMs allow AF-1 to exert its ligand-independent function, they block AF-2 activity and inhibit interaction between coactivators and the LBD of ERs . Moreover, steroid-induced phosphorylation of SRC-3 is nuclear receptor specific. Previously, we showed that androgen can induce SRC-3 phosphorylation , but in this report we demonstrate that neither PR-B nor GR is able to induce phosphorylation of any of the six known SRC-3 phosphorylation sites in response to their cognate ligands. This dichotomy suggests that the extensive phosphorylation of SRC-3 induced by estrogen and androgen may relate to the well-known growth-promoting actions of their cognate receptors. However, failure to induce extensive phosphorylation was surprising in view of the ability of SRC-3 to coactivate and participate in nuclear PR-B- and GR-dependent gene expression, albeit in conjunction with SRC-1 and SRC-2, respectively . Conceivably, PR or GR and their cognate ligands may induce phosphorylation of SRC-3 at sites distinct from those known to be phosphorylated in response to ER or AR ligands. Nonetheless, the differences between ER/AR and GR/PR and their cognate ligands, relative to their abilities to induce SRC-3 phosphorylation, indicate that the relative importance of SRC-3 phosphorylation at the six sites tested can be receptor specific. Consistent with the model that E2-induced coactivator phosphorylation can be mediated through the transcription-independent and ""nongenomic"" signaling of ER, we showed that ER nuclear localization is not required for promoting SRC-3 phosphorylation. It has been shown that both ER and SRC-3 shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus , and the collective data indicate that SRC-3 phosphorylation can occur in both cytoplasm and nucleus and that it generally promotes nuclear localization of SRC-3 . For example, TNF- induces phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SRC-3, and nuclear SRC-3 is hyperphosphorylated compared to the cytoplasmic fraction , indicating that SRC-3 may be partially phosphorylated in the cytoplasm and further phosphorylated after translocation to the nucleus and recruitment to the promoter. However, the precise extent to which each of the six known sites of SRC-3 is phosphorylated in each component is unknown. Our model, in which E2-induced SRC-3 phosphorylation occurs in a complex with either ER or ER, suggests that the high proximity of receptor and coactivator may enable the same kinase to efficiently phosphorylate SRC-3 and ER in response to E2. Indeed, the kinases ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, protein kinase A, and IKK can phosphorylate both ER and SRC family members . However, the mechanism of kinase recruitment to the complex is not clear. It is possible that E2-bound ER can first recruit kinases via its AF-1 or AF-2 domain, allowing subsequent phosphorylation of SRC-3, or vice versa. Alternatively, a kinase could be recruited by either ER or SRC-3 to an E2-induced preexisting complex of SRC-3 and ER, followed by phosphorylation of both molecules. Although our current data cannot distinguish between these models, or whether the ER is attached to the membrane , our results indicate that phosphorylation of three of the major phosphorylation sites of the ER AF-1 domain is not a prerequisite for SRC-3 phosphorylation. In addition to its phosphorylation by an E2/ER-dependent pathway, SRC-3 phosphorylation also can be induced by growth factors and cytokines . Previously, we reported that TNF-alpha induces phosphorylation of SRC-3 in an ER-independent fashion and that the patterns of phosphorylated residues induced by TNF-alpha and E2 overlapped but were not identical . Moreover, these distinct phosphorylation patterns lead to distinct effects on SRC-3 association with nuclear receptors, other transcription factors (e.g., NF-B), and coregulators (e.g., CBP and CARM1), leading to distinct potentials for maximal transcriptional output . It is highly probable that the stimuli encountered by SRC-3, and hence its phosphorylation pattern and coactivator activity, will be cell and tissue specific. For example, in HER2-overexpressing breast cancers, SRC-3 phosphorylation induced by HER2 signaling may facilitate coactivator function under conditions of low E2 or tamoxifen exposure and thereby contribute to endocrine resistance (4, 49, 60). Indeed, tamoxifen induces SRC-3 phosphorylation as shown by its mobility shift and phosphatase treatment and serves as an agonist of ER/SRC-3-dependent transcription in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells . However, the status of SRC-3 phosphorylation at each of the six sites in the presence of high levels of HER2 has not been investigated yet. In contrast, estrogen may attenuate cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli, such as the cytokine TNF-alpha, because of E2-induced phosphorylation of SRC-3 that renders the coactivator less effective at cytokine target genes."
