Even more than Ras, ASPP2 is common, as is its ubiquitination.
To address the effect of Ras ubiquitination on its binding to PI3K and Raf family members, either total G12V-K-Ras or the ubiquitinated subfraction of G12V-K-Ras was immunoprecipitated.
Much work has been done on ASPP2. It is known that Ras binds it.
Ras and Mek are in proximity, and they phosphorylate ASPP2.
