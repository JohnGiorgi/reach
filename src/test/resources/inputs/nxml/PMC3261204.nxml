In cancers, compromised phosphatase activity and/or expression occur and contribute to tumor phenotype. The non-receptor phosphatase, PTPN13, has recently been dubbed a putative tumor suppressor. It decreased expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival. Here we show that PTPN13 regulates a new signaling complex in breast cancer consisting of ErbB2, Src, and EphrinB1. To our knowledge, this signaling complex has not been previously described. Co-immunoprecipitation and localization studies demonstrate that EphrinB1, a PTPN13 substrate, interacts with ErbB2. In addition, the oncogenic V660E ErbB2 mutation enhances this interaction, while Src kinase mediates EphrinB1 phosphorylation and subsequent MAP Kinase signaling. Decreased PTPN13 function further enhances signaling. The association of oncogene kinases (ErbB2, Src), a signaling transmembrane ligand (EphrinB1) and a phosphatase tumor suppressor (PTPN13) suggest that EphrinB1 may be a relevant therapeutic target in breast cancers harboring ErbB2-activating mutations and decreased PTPN13 expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>ErbB2 (Her2) amplification/over-expression occurs in 20-30&#x00025; of breast cancers resulting in aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Slamon1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Slamon2">[2]</xref>. ErbB2 activation via hetero-dimerization with other family members or homo-dimerization with itself (when expressed at high levels) initiates intracellular signals that culminate in transcription of many genes regulating proliferation, survival, differentiation, invasion and metastasis. In this way, ErbB2 plays a key role in orchestrating an aggressive breast cancer phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Gutierrez1">[3]</xref>. The advancement of targeted therapies such as trastuzumab, a humanized anti-ErbB2 antibody, improves survival of Her2 breast cancer patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Gianni1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Jahanzeb1">[5]</xref>. However, most patients do not respond to trastuzumab (62-74&#x00025;), harboring <italic>de novo</italic> resistance; those that do respond benefit greatly with an increased probability of surviving over five years or remaining tumor free. Regrettably, 25&#x00025; of these initially responding patients later fail therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Fessler1">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Moss1">[9]</xref>. Like <italic>de novo</italic> resistance, the pathways leading to acquired trastuzumab resistance remain unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Gajria1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Kang1">[11]</xref>. While significant progress has been made in understanding the role of ErbB2 in breast cancer initiation and progression, the overwhelming resistance to trastuzumab therapy suggests that additional signaling pathways exist that circumvent ErbB2 antibody-mediated blockade. Characterizing these pathways and, more importantly, the proteins that initiate them, will define novel targets for therapeutic intervention that may re-sensitize Her2 patients to trastuzumab and improve survival.</p><p>In addition to amplification/over-expression, polymorphisms in ErbB2 at codon 655 (within the transmembrane domain) are associated with increased development of breast cancer in some populations, suggesting that changes in the ErbB2 coding sequence may also have functional consequences associated with cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Papadopoulou1">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Papadopoulou3">[14]</xref>. ErbB2 coding sequences may affect associations with partner proteins and subsequently alter ErbB2-mediated intracellular signaling. Thus, like trastuzumab resistance, identifying these pathways will be critical for defining therapies that block or circumvent them, improving survival.</p><p>While dominant pro-oncogenic functions like those described for the ErbB2 kinase in breast cancer occur frequently in solid tumors, alterations in phosphatases likewise occur and function as tumor suppressors. For example, the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN13 (also known as FAP1, PTPL1, PTPLE, PTPBAS, PTP1E; PTP-BL is the mouse homolog) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Dromard1">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Yeh1">[17]</xref> has recently been dubbed a putative tumor suppressor. PTPN13 is a multi-module containing phosphatase. Its five PDZ protein-protein interaction domains mediate associations with many cellular proteins and, as such, suggest that PTPN13 mutations may alter a variety of different cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Abaan1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Erdmann1">[19]</xref>. PTPN13 mutations have, in fact, been identified in colorectal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Wang1">[16]</xref>, head and neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Niu1">[20]</xref> and liver cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Yeh1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Lee1">[21]</xref>. Importantly, decreased PTPN13 expression in breast cancer correlates with decreased overall survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Revillion1">[22]</xref>. Moreover, we previously found that decreased PTPN13 expression synergizes with an activated ErbB2 transmembrane mutation (mNeuNT) enhancing tumor growth and invasion <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoover1">[23]</xref>. While in humans amplification/over-expression of ErbB2 is oncogenic, in animals activating transmembrane ErbB2 mutations are required for tumor growth. Thus, our <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse studies necessitate the use of mNeuNT, a constitutively active transmembrane ErbB2 mutation. However, the finding that human ErbB2 polymorphisms can affect breast cancer prevalence suggests that the study of transmembrane activating ErbB2 mutations in animals (in the absence of amplification/over-expression) may prove beneficial in the context of human disease. While a study by Zhu <italic>et al.</italic> suggests that PTPN13 regulates ErbB2 function directly by de-phosphorylating the ErbB2 signal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Aguila1">[24]</xref>, we have not found that in our system suggesting that PTPN13 and activated ErbB2 alone cannot account for the enhanced downstream signaling, tumor growth, and invasion evident in our published studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoover1">[23]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that additional modifiers function in the PTPN13/ErbB2 synergy observed. We further reasoned that a PTPN13 phosphatase substrate with signaling capacities may be one such candidate molecule. Therefore, we analyzed EphrinB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Palmer1">[25]</xref>.</p><p>EphrinB1 belongs to a family of ligands that bind and activate Eph receptor tyrosine kinases. Ephrin ligands are unique, binding and activating signaling from their cognate receptors, and themselves becoming phosphorylated and initiating their own signaling cascades. This Ephrin specific characteristic is called &#x0201c;reverse&#x0201d; signaling. &#x0201c;Reverse&#x0201d; signaling following Eph receptor engagement constitutes the conventional signaling pathway. However, Ephrins are promiscuous in their associations and signaling occurs following non-Eph receptor interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Lee2">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Tanaka1">[27]</xref>. This type of Ephrin signaling is non-conventional.</p><p>Given that EphrinB1 is a phosphatase substrate of PTPN13, decreased PTPN13 expression or functional PTPN13 mutations (both of which occur in solid tumors) likely result in increased EphrinB1 phosphorylation and subsequent signaling. In the context of breast cancer where decreased PTPN13 expression correlates with poor survival, defining the pathways activated in the absence of PTPN13 may identify critical targets for therapeutic intervention and improve survival. Thus, we hypothesized that the synergy between decrease PTPN13 and increased ErbB2 activation that drives tumor growth and invasion is mediated via EphrinB1 and, further, that EphrinB1-mediated signaling is enhanced in breast cancers with compromised PTPN13 expression. Here, we describe a novel association between ErbB2 and EphrinB1. Expression of an activated ErbB2 mutant or over-expression of wildtype ErbB2 (as in Her2 breast cancers), together with decreased PTPN13 expression or function, not only enhances complex formation but also leads to EphrinB1 phosphorylation and associated downstream signaling. In this report, we characterize this complex, the signals mediated from it, and its relevance to breast cancer. In addition, we demonstrate that this complex exists in other epithelial cells and suggest that signaling from the complex plays a functional role in other solid tumors as well.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PTPN13 Loss occurs in epithelial cancers</title><p>Decreased PTPN13 expression correlates with decreased overall survival in breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Revillion1">[22]</xref>. We wondered whether this correlation existed across all types of breast cancers or if it was specific to a particular subtype. Thus, we analyzed a gene expression array from 200 early stage breast cancers and 7 normal breast samples for PTPN13 with particular attention to subtype specificity. While Her2, Luminal A, Luminal B breast cancers and normal breast samples express relatively high levels of PTPN13, basal-like (BL) tumors express significantly lower levels of PTPN13 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.00044 for basal vs. normal). Comparisons of the other subtypes with normal breast were not significant. However, while PTPN13 mRNA levels in Her2, Luminal A and Luminal B breast cancers is not different than normal breast, the data do not eliminate the possibility that PTPN13 functional mutations occur in these subtypes that may result in a phenotype similar to that found in its absence.</p><fig id="pone-0030447-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0030447.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Decreased PTPN13 expression occurs in BL tumors and correlates with increased EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Relative PTPN13 mRNA expression of PTPN13 in molecularly characterized breast tumors.

While PTPN13 expression varied among cell lines, three out of four of the BL cell lines tested exhibited nearly absent PTPN13 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The BL tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of cancers, but in general, are aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Chacon1">[29]</xref>. Thus, our findings are consistent with those of Revillion <italic>et al</italic> correlating decreased PTPN13 expression and poor overall survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Revillion1">[22]</xref>. These data support the hypothesis that loss of PTPN13 expression impacts tumor phenotype and suggest that PTPN13 plays a role in regulating epithelial proliferation, migration and/or invasion in BL breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PTPN13 loss increases phosphorylated EphrinB1 and Erk1/2</title><p>PTPN13&#x02032;s five PDZ domains mediate associations with many proteins, including EphrinB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Erdmann1">[19]</xref>.

To test the effects of decreased/lost PTPN13 on EphrinB1 phosphorylation, we examined two BL breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB231, expressing nearly undetectable PTPN13 protein, and MDA-MB468, expressing endogenous PTPN13 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As expected, low PTPN13 expression (MDA-MB231) correlates with increased EphrinB1phosphorylation while endogenous PTPN13 expression (MDA-MB468) correlates with low phospho-EphrinB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). These data are consistent with EphrinB1 being a PTPN13 phosphatase substrate and suggest that decreased PTPN13 expression in BL breast cancer cell lines increases phosphorylation of EphrinB1.</p><p>Given EphrinB1&#x02032;s ability to signal, we further asked whether phosphorylated EphrinB1 correlated with increased downstream signaling. Molecular analysis of BL breast carcinomas shows that many gene products in the BL cluster are associated with MEK/Erk activation, thus we chose to analyze the phosphorylation status of Erk1/2 in these BL cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-OliverasFerraros1">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoadley1">[33]</xref>. We found that decreased/absent PTPN13 expression (MDA-MB231) correlates with increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1C</xref>); while endogenous PTPN13 expression (MDA-MB468) correlates with decreased Erk1/2 phosphorylation. These data suggest that EphrinB1 activation (phosphorylation) signals via the MAP Kinase pathway. To test this, we stably knocked-down EphrinB1 in HEK293 cells, chosen due to their ease of transfection relative to breast cancer cell lines. Knock-down of EphrinB1 results in prominent attenuation of phosphorylated Erk1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) consistent with EphrinB1-mediated Erk1/2 activation. Taken together, the data suggest that the absence of PTPN13 results in enhanced EphrinB1 activation and concomitant Erk1/2 phosphorylation.</p><p>As a further test, endogenous PTPN13 was transiently knocked-down in MDA-MB468 cells (shRNA-mediated, shPTPN13). As predicted, PTPN13 knock-down increased phosphorylation of EphrinB1 consistent with PTPN13 regulation of EphrinB1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Palmer1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, increased EphrinB1 associated with ErbB2 in lysates from shPTPN13 cells suggesting that phosphorylated EphrinB1 associates more readily with ErbB2 as compared to unphosphorylated EphrinB1. Surprisingly, PTPN13 knock-down did not affect Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggesting that either EphrinB1 does not signal via the MAP Kinase pathway in MDA-MB468 cells or that its signaling is modulated in these cells via additional (as yet undefined) components.</p><p>Previous attempts by our laboratory to over-express PTPN13 have been unsuccessful as its increased expression results in cell death, thus limiting our ability to analyze its downstream effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Spanos1">[34]</xref>. Therefore, we were unable to test the effects of over-expressing PTPN13 in MDA-MB231 cells which lack endogenous expression. However, given its affects on EphrinB1 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells, we speculated that a reduction in PTPN13 expression or function may be a common and, more importantly, a key alteration in other epithelial cancers. To test this concept, we knocked-down PTPN13 in a human keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT cells) and analyzed its affects on signaling. Decreased PTPN13 expression indeed enhanced EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, HaCaT). Similarly, knock-down of PTPN13 in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell line, UM-SCC84, resulted in increased EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, UM-SCC84). Importantly, previous studies focused on human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated head and neck cancers demonstrate that the HPV16 E6 oncoprotein binds and targets PTPN13 for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Spanos1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoover2">[35]</xref>. Thus, HPV positive cells served as an additional test of the function of PTPN13 in cellular signaling in the context of <italic>virally</italic>-mediated cancer. Thus, we analyzed previously characterized mouse tonsil epithelial cells stably expression HPV16 E6 or those stably knocked-down for PTPN13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Spanos1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoover2">[35]</xref>. Indeed, HPV16 E6 expression enhanced EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, consistent with decreased/lost PTPN13 expression. Moreover, knock-down of PTPN13 in mouse tonsil epithelial cells demonstrated a similar effect (shPTPN13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that decreased PTPN13 expression enhances EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation in epithelial cells. The finding that high risk HPV viruses have evolved a mechanism to eliminate cellular PTPN13, further emphasizes the importance of PTPN13 regulatory functions critical in cellular signaling pathways. The data suggest that PTPN13 expression may be interesting to evaluate in many, if not all, solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>ErbB2 co-immunoprecipitates and co-localizes with EphrinB1</title><p>The above data suggest that decreased/lost PTPN13 increases EphrinB1 activation which may then modulate downstream phosphorylation of Erk1/2. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated that decreased/lost PTPN13 synergizes with ErbB2, potentiating MAP Kinase signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Hoover1">[23]</xref>. Thus, we wondered whether EphrinB1 phosphorylation and the resulting Erk1/2 signaling occurs in an ErbB2-mediated, non-conventional manner. Therefore, we asked whether EphrinB1 associates with ErbB2 and completed co-precipitation and co-localization studies. We found that EphrinB1 and ErbB2 co-precipitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) from lysates derived from breast cancer cell lines as well as HaCaT cells. Interestingly, knock-down of PTPN13 in HaCaT cells (shPTPN13) enhanced pull-down of EphrinB1 with ErbB2, again suggesting that phosphorylated EphrinB1 associates more readily with ErbB2 than the unphosphorylated state. In addition, in all cases multiple forms of EphrinB1 were pulled down with ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g002">Figure 2A</xref> arrows).

While the identity of these bands is undefined in this study, different EphrinB1 antibodies verified its co-immunoprecipitation with ErbB2 (data not shown). Importantly, while varying amounts of ErbB2 were pulled down in all lysates tested (consistent with their different levels of ErbB2 expression), a similar amount of EphrinB1 was associated with it. These data suggest that there is a limit to the amount of EphrinB1 that associates with ErbB2; more ErbB2 expression does not result in increased EphrinB1 association. These data suggest that the interaction is tightly regulated.</p><fig id="pone-0030447-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0030447.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>mNeuNT is required for EphrinB1 activation and initiation of signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT cells (control as well as cells knocked-down for PTPN13), and breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, BT474, HCC1953) immunoprecipitated (IP) for ErbB2 and immunoblotted (IB) for EphrinB1.

Surface EphrinB was localized on unfixed, unpermeabilized cells using EphB1-Fc. EphB1-Fc is a chimera consisting of the extracellular region of the EphB1 receptor (a cognate EphrinB receptor) fused to human IgG<sub>1</sub>. Thus, EphB1-Fc binds to surface expressed EphrinB ligands. These interactions are then detected using an anti-human IgG-FITC and cells analyzed by confocal microscopy. Thus, while the surface staining is not specific to EphrinB1alone, it does suggest that EphrinB proteins co-localize with ErbB2. Together with the immunoprecipitation data, these data suggest that EphrinB1 associates with ErbB2.</p><p>To assess the significance of the ErbB2/EphrinB1 interaction in breast cancer, we further analyzed: BT474, a Her2 (ErbB2) cell line; T47D, a luminal cell line with high ErbB2 expression; MCF7, another luminal cell line with low ErbB2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Immunoprecipitation for ErbB2 followed by western blot analysis for EphrinB1 demonstrates enhanced EphrinB1 co-IP in T47D cells which correlated with higher levels of phosphorylated EphrinB1. This finding is consistent with our previous data suggesting that phosphorylated EphrinB1 associates more readily with ErbB2.

In addition, we present similar findings using multiple human cell lines suggesting that complex formation and signaling occurs in many, if not all, epithelial cells. With respect to breast cancer, ErbB2/EphrinB1 signaling may be most relevant in tumors with high ErbB2 expression and either low/absent PTPN13 expression or those harboring PTPN13 functional mutations.

Interestingly, both MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB468 cells lack detectable (by western blot) ErbB2 expression yet, in the absence of PTPN13, EphrinB1 is phosphorylated. Both of these BL breast cancer cell lines demonstrate over-expression of ErbB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-OliverasFerraros1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Song1">[46]</xref> suggesting that ErbB1 may hetero-dimerize with low levels of endogenous ErbB2 (forming an ErbB1/ErbB2/EphrinB1 complex) and mediate signaling from the complex. It remains unclear why transient knock-down of PTPN13 in MDA-MB468 cells failed to increased Erk1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) though a few possibilities exist. First, while the extent of PTPN13 knock-down was not very efficient, it was enough to increase EphrinB1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggests that either EphrinB1 does not signal via the MAP Kinase pathway, or that the specific EphrinB1 tyrosine(s) necessary to mediate such signaling were not activated under this condition. Our data demonstrating that knock-down of EphrinB1 greatly attenuates Erk1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) argue against the former possibility and support the latter. Second, the presence of high ErbB1 expression in MDA-MB468 cells and the fact that these cells were not serum-starved suggests that ErbB1 signaling (either alone or in combination with low level endogenous ErbB2) modulates downstream pathways which include Erk1/2. Third, it is possible that the ErbB2/EphrinB1 complex is composed of additional components (in fact, we hypothesize this is true), the composition of which may differ among different cell lines and may respond differently under different contexts. Further characterization of the ErbB2/EphrinB1 complex, its association with additional transmembrane proteins (including ErbB family members), as well as intracellular binding partners and the signaling pathways they regulate are on-going and will increase our understanding of the function of this complex in breast cancer. What is clear from these experiments is that EphrinB1 associates with ErbB2 and its phosphorylation is regulated by PTPN13. The absence of PTPN13, as occurs in BL breast cancers, affects EphrinB1 phosphorylation and likely downstream signaling, which may include components of the MAP Kinase pathway.</p><p>Given its over-expression in Her2 breast cancers, we further studied the ErbB2/EphrinB1 association in additional breast cancer cell lines. T47D cells which express high levels of ErbB2 and nearly undetectable PTPN13, demonstrate increased ErbB2/EphrinB1 association, elevated EphrinB1 activation and robust Erk1/2 phosphorylation. BT474 cells which demonstrate robust ErbB2 expression and high PTPN13 expression, lack Erk1/2 phosphorylation while MCF7 cells, with low expression of both ErbB2 and PTPN13, also have undetectable phosphorylation of Erk1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). These data suggest that the combination of low/absent PTPN13 and high ErbB2 expression are required for driving EphrinB1 and Erk1/2 phosphorylation.</p><p>Our studies also demonstrate that, whereas PTPN13 is the phosphatase silencing EphrinB1 activation, Src is the kinase that activates it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g003">Figure 3B, 3C</xref>). Thus, signaling from the ErbB2/EphrinB1 complex is regulated by transient associations with PTPN13 and Src. The interaction of two known kinase oncogenes (ErbB2 and Src), a signaling ligand (EphrinB1) and a putative tumor suppressor phosphatase (PTPN13) likely regulates key signals not limited to Erk1/2. In cancers where protein kinase oncogene expression and/or signaling are enhanced, signals mediated from this complex may be altered. Our data in breast cancer cell lines support this hypothesis.</p><p>The finding that wildtype ErbB2 associates with EphrinB1 but does not correlate with EphrinB1 or Erk1/2 phosphorylation, suggests that in the absence of ErbB2 activation, Src either does not associate with the complex or remains in an inactive form. In fact, we show that mNeuNT (but not wildtype ErbB2) associates with activated Src, consistent with a requirement for activated ErbB2 to initiate complex signaling. These findings are highly relevant not only for Her2 breast cancers but also for epithelial cancers harboring activating ErbB2 mutations.</p><p>mNeuNT association with activated Src suggests that ErbB2 sequence alterations not only enhance complex formation but also initiate its signaling.

Our ErbB2/EphrinB1 truncation experiments also support a functional role for the transmembrane domains.

For example, while blocking ErbB2 with trastuzumab (Herceptin) may effectively block ErbB2-mediated signals, it may not alter EphrinB1-mediated signaling from the complex. Our data demonstrate that in the absence of EphrinB1, Erk1/2 phosphorylation is greatly attenuated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) suggesting not only that EphrinB1 is a good therapeutic target, but that blocking EphrinB1 together with ErbB2 may efficiently inhibit complex signaling. Our data further suggest that breast cancers with elevated ErbB2 expression and compromised PTPN13 expression and/or function would benefit the most from this type of dual targeting.</p><p>Decreased PTPN13 expression in BL breast cancers supports a tumor suppressive role for PTPN13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). BL breast cancers do not express the estrogen or progesterone receptors nor do they over-express ErbB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Sorlie1">[56]</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0030447-Perou1">[58]</xref>. Thus, these patients do not benefit from targeted therapies, contributing to their poor outcome. Moreover, while only Her2 breast cancers demonstrate over-expression/amplification of Her2, the other breast cancer subtypes express Her2, albeit at normal levels. However, our data suggest that it is the combination of increased ErbB2 together with compromised PTPN13 that is necessary for EphrinB1 activation and downstream signaling. Despite this, MDA-MB231 cells demonstrate EphrinB1 activation and robust Erk1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030447-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The key to these data may lie in the fact that this cell line (as well as MDA-MB468) expresses high levels of ErbB1 suggesting that EphrinB1 associates with additional ErbB family members. We have some preliminary data suggesting this is indeed the case (data not shown). Thus, complex formation in BL breast cancers is likely to occur with downstream signaling amplified in the absence of PTPN13 and over-expression of ErbB1 or other ErbB family members.</p><p>This is the first study to describe a novel complex between ErbB2 and EphrinB1 that is not restricted to breast cancer cell lines but is present in many epithelial cell lines tested. Importantly, ErbB2/EphrinB1 interactions may occur <italic>in cis</italic> (within the same cell) or <italic>in trans</italic> (across neighboring cells) mediating dual or bi-directional signals, respectively. The concept of dual/bi-directional signaling in the arena of breast cancer is new and untested with potential implications for tumor growth. Further studies focused on identifying additional components of the ErbB2/EphrinB1 complex and the downstream pathways they regulate may identify additional targets for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer and other solid tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors</title><p>shRNA vectors were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL).
